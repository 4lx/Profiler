Themes:
-Exporting message(s) to file system
-Opening exported files and putting them into the queue
-Fixing the "return to source queue" feature
-Displaying a tree list of the message object (as another view like binary, xml, etc.)
-Supporting different encoding on the messages (UTF/ASCII/Binary?)
-Allowing editing the message in the xml editor (at least), potentially all views (including binary view)
-Bulk sending a message from file/clipboard. Probably can be NSB specific.
-Connecting to multiple servers at once(?)
-Localization of the messages/UI/Errors and strings

Tasks:
-Adding Select all context menu to message list
-Adding message delete functionality to message list context menu
-Adding message save/export functionality to message list context menu
-Loading messages in a more efficient way (separate header and detail/body information). Also similarly get the message count in the queue (instead of loading messages and getting the count).
-Revamp the plugin model and tab layouts, need to create tabs per functionality (Performance, Informational, Security, Body/Message View)


Refactorings:
-Makes more sense to have connection information (MachineName) in QueueManager and MSMQ abstraction layer should just work with passed in FullName of the queue (or address/queue name) instead.


Bugs:
-When deleting a groupped set of queues (queue with related system queues) all of them should be removed.
